Object Detection Module for Robotics
This repository contains the object_detector.py script, a key component of a robotic vision system designed to detect and analyze objects based on color within a simulated environment using ROS (Robot Operating System). This module is part of a larger project aimed at implementing a sophisticated object manipulation and recognition system for automated tasks.

Project Overview
The object_detector.py script utilizes OpenCV and ROS to detect objects within a camera's field of view in a Gazebo simulation environment. The script identifies objects by their color signatures and calculates their positions, dimensions, and the estimated depth from the camera lens.

Key Features
Color-based Object Detection: Utilizes HSV color space to differentiate objects based on predefined color ranges.
3D Position Estimation: Combines depth sensing and camera calibration to compute the 3D coordinates of detected objects relative to the camera.
ROS Integration: Fully integrated with ROS, allowing for easy deployment on robotic systems and simulation in environments like Gazebo.
Dynamic Object Tracking: Capable of tracking multiple objects simultaneously and updating their positions in real-time.
Technologies Used
ROS: Robot Operating System provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications.
OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library that extends its capabilities towards computer vision and machine learning.
Python: The project is scripted in Python, leveraging its vast ecosystem of libraries for rapid development and prototyping.
Gazebo: Simulation environment used to test and refine the detection algorithms in a controlled setting.
Setup and Configuration
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
Build and Run in ROS Workspace:
Navigate to your catkin workspace and build the project:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
Launch the Object Detector:
Ensure the ROS master is running and launch the object detector:

bash
Copy code
roslaunch your_package object_detector.launch
Viewing the Output:
The detected objects and their attributes can be viewed in the ROS topic /object_detection, which publishes a custom message containing the detected objects' details.
